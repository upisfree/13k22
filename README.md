## [Play here](http://upisfr.ee/game/13k22/)
Controls: WASD + mouse

This is a shooter with real-time raytracing that fits in only 7kb.
Build for js13kb contest.
Graphics, music, raytracing, everything fits in 7kb.
It's rendered in 100x100 canvas with 30 fps.

Raytracing engine by me. Music done with [ZzFXM](https://github.com/keithclark/ZzFXM). Textures are emojies.

The game itself was done in 2 days, raytracing engine was done in 3 really lazy weeks.

This [article](https://www.gabrielgambetta.com/computer-graphics-from-scratch/00-introduction.html) helped a lot with raytracing implementation.

Do not really looked in the code, it was written in real rush and I thought I will refactor it to fit in 13kb, but when I just minified and zipped it, I found that it fits in 7kb and didn't do anything to refactor it, haha :)
