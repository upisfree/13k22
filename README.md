Controls: WASD + mouse

This is a shooter with real-time raytracing that fits in only 7kb.
Build for js13kb contest.
Graphics, music, raytracing, everything fits in 7kb.
It's rendered in 100x100 canvas with 30 fps.

Raytracing engine by me. Music done with [ZzFXM](https://github.com/keithclark/ZzFXM). Textures are emojies.

The game itself was done in 2 days, raytracing engine was done in 3 really lazy weeks.

This [article](https://www.gabrielgambetta.com/computer-graphics-from-scratch/00-introduction.html) helped a lot with raytracing implementation.
